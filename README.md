### Continuous Delivery with Heroku and GitHub.
This example is fully integrated with Heroku platform (pipeline with review, stage and production applications). 

\* Obs: This example is just about Continuous Delivery. With you want to see the same example with Continuous Integration included, check it out  in my GitLab account: [GitLab]    (https://gitlab.com/marcosricardoss/hello-heroku-ci-cd)

\** Obs: You can continue to use GitHub as your main version control and run CI/CD pipelines on GitLab by just connecting the GitHub repository in a GitLab repository and the project will be created with only CI/CD features enabled. So the whole process of deployment and testing will be done by GitLab.

#### Contributing

Whether reporting bugs, discussing improvements and new ideas or writing extensions: Contributions are welcome! Here's how to get started:

1. Fork the repository on Github, create a new branch off the master branch and start making your changes (known as[ GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html " GitHub Flow"))
2. Write a test which shows that the bug was fixed or that the feature works as expected
3. Send a pull request and bug the maintainer until it gets merged and published
