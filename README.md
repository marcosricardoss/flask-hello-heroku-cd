### FLask CI/CD with Heroku

This example of Continuous Delivery with Heroku and GitHub and and It can be used fully integrated with Heroku platform (pipeline with review, stage and production applications). 

\* Obs: This example is just about Continuous Delivery. With you want to see the same example with Continuous Integration included, check it out in my GitLab account: https://gitlab.com/marcosricardoss/hello-heroku-ci-cd

\** Obs: You can use GitHub integrated with GitLab. By connecting the GitHub repository to a GitLab repository, the GitLab project will be created with only CI/CD features enabled. So you can keep using the GitHub as your main version control, but the whole process of deployment and testing will be done by GitLab.
